1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/asilmb/business-card-project-wallet.git
    cd business-card-project-wallet
    ```
2.  **Copy the environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.dist .env
    ```
3.  **Build and run containers:**
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

## Project Roadmap

### Epic 1: Core Infrastructure & Authentication (MVP Core) üèÜ

- **User Story 1.1:** As a user, I want to register using email and password.
- **User Story 1.2:** As a registered user, I want to log in and receive a JWT token for secure API access.
- **User Story 1.3:** As an authenticated user, I want my requests to protected endpoints to be authorized.

---

### Epic 2: Budget and Accounts Management (YNAB Foundation)
- **User Story 2.1:** As a user, I want to create my first budget (e.g., "Family Budget").
- **User Story 2.2:** As a user, I want to add accounts to my budget (e.g., "Visa Card", "Cash").
    - *Technical details:* Account has `name` and `current_balance`.
- **User Story 2.3:** As a user, I want to see the total sum of money across all my accounts.

---

### Epic 3: Categories and Money Allocation (Rule 1: *Give Every Dollar a Job*)
- **User Story 3.1:** As a user, I want to create category groups (e.g., "Monthly Expenses", "Savings").
- **User Story 3.2:** As a user, I want to create categories inside groups (e.g., "Groceries", "Rent", "Vacation").
    - *Technical details:* Category has `name` and `assigned_balance` (how much money is allocated).
- **User Story 3.3:** As a user, I want to allocate money from accounts to categories.
    - *Key logic:* When I allocate $100 to "Groceries", that category‚Äôs `assigned_balance` increases by $100.  
      The **Ready to Assign** balance decreases by $100.
- **User Story 3.4:** As a user, I want to see the total "Ready to Assign" amount.
    - *Formula:* `SUM(account balances) - SUM(category assigned balances)`

---

### Epic 4: Transactions and Expense Tracking
- **User Story 4.1:** As a user, I want to add a transaction (income or expense).
    - *Technical details:* Transaction has `date`, `payee`, `amount`, `account_id`, and `category_id` (if expense).
- **User Story 4.2:** When adding an expense:
    - The account balance decreases.
    - The category balance decreases.
- **User Story 4.3:** When adding income:
    - The account balance increases.
    - The **Ready to Assign** balance increases by the same amount.
- **User Story 4.4:** As a user, I want to see a list of all transactions filtered by account or category.
